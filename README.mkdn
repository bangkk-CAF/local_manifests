just run this command before doing 'repo sync'

```bash
python3 .repo/local_manifests/bangkk.py  .repo/manifests/default.xml .repo/manifests/snippets/* .repo/local_manifests .repo/local_manifests/a-remove.xml
```
note: this only works for basic roms like 'LineageOS or aosp', if you want to make some CAF ROM or something like that you will have to make modifications.
